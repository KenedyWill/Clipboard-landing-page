## My process

### Built with

- Semantic **HTML5** markup  
- **CSS** custom properties  
- Responsive design principles  

### What I learned

While building this project, I learned how to use **div elements** effectively and improved my understanding of basic HTML and CSS structure.

```html
<div class="feature">
  <h2>Some HTML I'm proud of</h2>
</div>
```

### Continued development

I plan to continue studying and improving my **HTML** and **CSS** skills, since web development is something I really enjoy learning about.

### Useful resources

- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) â€“ This resource helped me a lot to understand HTML and CSS concepts more clearly.
